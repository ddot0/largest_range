The problem required a function that takes in an array and returns an array of the two integers in the array that represent the largest range of integers in the array. 

The approach I took was to construct a set to increase efficiency as any duplicates would be irrelevant. I created variables for the size of the range and the integers that would be immediately before and after a given integer. Using an active range count I was able to identify which array of consecutive numbers would have the highest range and then display the boundary integers that were calculated through the while statements.

The code passed all test cases on the AlgoExpert problem page.
